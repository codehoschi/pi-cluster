Don't know about storing private keys in password manager.
Basically there are only text fields and the formating seems wrong.
No Luck with Sprig encoding/formating the sting into valid private key.

!!! Didn't try notes as SecretStore. Maybe !!!

- Wait until [Bitwarden Secret Manager](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/products/secrets-manager/) becomes available to selfhost.
- [Infisical](https://infisical.com/pricing), but needs yet another DB(Mongo).
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), only The KV Secrets Engine supported
